# vaccination
Code to simulate a SVIR process (Susceptible, Vaccinated, Infected and Recovered) on a network, considering:
- The topology of the contact network
- The diffusion of anti-vacination views
- Some simulated demographics (age and death of individuals)

It produces:
- The size of the anti-vaccine community
- The time for anti-vaccine views to propagate
- The size of the recovered individuals
- The time for the virus to stop spreading
- The years of life lost
- The number of casualties
